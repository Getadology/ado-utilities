The provided code snippet is a part of an AWS Lambda function that processes SQS messages, downloads videos, uploads them to S3, and updates MongoDB collections. Here's a summary of its functionality:

### Summary

1. **Imports and Initializations**:
   - Imports necessary libraries for asynchronous operations (

asyncio

,

aiohttp

,

aiobotocore

), MongoDB interactions (

pymongo

), AWS services (

boto3

), and other utilities.
   - Initializes MongoDB client and connects to the `topadology_db` database.
   - Initializes AWS S3, SNS, and SQS clients.
   - Retrieves configuration values from environment variables.

2. **Asynchronous Download and Upload**:
   ```python
   async def download_and_upload(session, s3_client, video):
       # Downloads video using streaming and uploads it to S3.
   ```

   - Downloads video content using streaming and uploads it to S3.
   - Uses

aiohttp

 for HTTP requests and

aiobotocore

 for S3 operations.

3. **Processing Files Concurrently**:
   ```python
   async def process_files(files_data):
       # Processes all files concurrently
   ```

   - Processes multiple files concurrently by creating tasks for each file download and upload.

4. **Notify User**:
   ```python
   def notify_user(data, user_id):
       # Notifies the user via a socket connection
   ```

   - Sends a notification to the user via a socket connection using the

requests

 library.

5. **Process Message**:
   ```python
   def process_message(message, receipt_handle):
       # Processes the SQS message
   ```

   - Extracts relevant data from the SQS message.
   - Calls

process_files

 to download and upload files.
   - Returns a success or error response based on the outcome.

6. **Lambda Handler Function**:
   ```python
   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       # Main entry point for the Lambda function
   ```

   - Processes each record in the SQS event.
   - Calls

process_message

 for each message.
   - Inserts batch information into the

batches

 collection in MongoDB.
   - Updates the

brand_states

 and

master_ads_meta

 collections based on the processing results.
   - Notifies the user if all batches are processed successfully.

### Key Points

- **Asynchronous Operations**: The code uses asynchronous operations to download and upload videos concurrently, improving efficiency.
- **AWS Services**: Utilizes AWS S3 for storage, SQS for message handling, and SNS for notifications.
- **MongoDB**: Interacts with MongoDB to store and update batch processing information.
- **User Notification**: Notifies users about the processing status via a socket connection.

This function is part of a larger system that processes advertisement data, downloads videos, uploads them to S3, and updates the processing status in MongoDB.
