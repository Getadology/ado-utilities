AWS Python System Development Prompt

Objective:
Build a Python-based system that acquires remote advertising content (images and videos) from various sources, processes the content with external AI routines, and efficiently stores the results—including embeddings in a FAISS vector database and metadata in a relational database.

System Overview:
	•	Content Acquisition:
	•	Start with a list of URLs (sourced from a command-line file or an SQS message) associated with a specific advertising brand.
	•	For each URL, initiate an asynchronous task that downloads the content and uploads it to Amazon S3.
	•	Control the level of concurrency (fan-out) to ensure efficient use of resources during these I/O-bound operations.
	•	AI Processing Pipeline:
	•	Stage 1: Per-Content Analysis
	•	Each image or video undergoes initial AI analysis (e.g., slicing, dicing, extracting features).
	•	The processing includes off-board AI calls to services (e.g., Amazon AI or other external providers) that compute embeddings and additional metrics.
	•	Intermediate analysis results are appended to a temporary, flat file specific to each URL.
	•	Stage 2: Aggregated Analysis
	•	Once individual content processing is complete, a second round of analysis is performed on the aggregated set of results.
	•	Additional AI cycles can be incorporated as needed.
	•	After processing, the temporary file data is finalized and re-uploaded to S3.
	•	Data Storage:
	•	Collect all temporary files for the brand and write the compiled data to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) in a single, efficient transaction.
	•	Store computed embeddings in a FAISS vector database for rapid similarity search and analysis.
	•	Modular AI Library:
	•	Develop a standardized interface for AI routines (from teams F and W) that abstracts the prompting and detailed processing logic.
	•	Each AI method should:
	•	Accept a block (or blocks) of data.
	•	Return structured results that can be seamlessly integrated into the pipeline.
	•	The library should be pluggable into the pipeline at designated points to maintain flexibility.
	•	Pipeline Execution:
	•	The entire process is orchestrated within a single asyncio task, maximizing efficiency for I/O-bound operations.
	•	Incorporate explicit conditionals and concurrency control to manage processing steps and resource allocation.
	•	Testing Harness:
	•	Create a testing framework that allows developers to run and validate individual AI methods independently.
	•	Ensure that the harness simulates real pipeline conditions to facilitate robust unit and integration testing.

Additional Considerations:
	•	Emphasize modular design and reusability across different components of the system.
	•	Implement robust error handling, logging, and monitoring to ensure resilience and observability.
	•	Secure AWS integrations (S3, SQS, etc.) following best practices for credentials and network access.
	•	Optimize temporary file handling and batch processing to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

This prompt outlines the high-level architecture and key components of the system, ensuring that the solution is scalable, efficient, and well-integrated with AWS services while providing flexibility for AI processing enhancements.
