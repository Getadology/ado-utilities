background info : ```

 

Adology is a intelligent service that analyzes digital advertising by applying knowledge processing to evaluate content(video, image, and text) as it is ingested into a permanent Adology repository.

At its core, Adology is not just a passive ad-tracking tool. Instead, it functions as an AI-powered intelligence engine that captures:

- The raw reality of ad creatives (metadata, images, videos, and text)
- The structured interpretation of these creatives (AI-generated labels, scores, and embeddings)
- The higher-level knowledge extracted from AI insights (brand-wide trends, comparative analysis, and strategic reports)

Adology’s architecture is designed to systematically store, analyze, and generate insights from advertising data. The system must support highly structured AI-driven analysis while also maintaining efficient retrieval of brand, ad, and intelligence reports—all within a cost-effective, scalable database structure.


Adology's data architecture supports multiple users within customer accounts, each managing multiple *brandspaces*. Each brandspace focuses on a primary brand, tracking competitor brands and followed brands to define the scope of intelligence gathering. A user can switch brandspaces for one customer organization at any time but requires a unique email and separate login to support multiple organizations.

Adology largely operates as a conventional, Internet-accessible database and content management service built on top of well-known data stores and access methods, including AWS, EC2, S3, SQS, Lambda, Postgres, Mongo, and Python. Its key value lies in intelligent, contextual analysis and notifications for advertising-based videos and imagery stored and maintained in real time. Newly ingested images and videos are archived in S3 and accessed directly via S3 URLs.

The APIs used by client programs (UX or background) support a Contextual Data Model that offers various convenient features and returns filtered, transformed, and AI-enhanced slices of the database. These REST APIs are documented at [https://adology.ai/live/…](https://adology.ai/live/…).

The data stores (S3, Postgres, Mongo) that power the Adology Contextual Data Model are filled by Acquisition Engines, which are EC2 or dynamically launched Lambda functions that pull data from remote sources, including Facebook, SerpApi, and customer-specific databases.

Most of the data, such as brands and advertising assets, is shared by all customers, whereas brandspaces are private to each customer.

Different non-UI components run on either EC2 or Lambda functions and are connected through a series of SQS queues. The SQS queues and Lambdas support parallelization of workflows for maximum concurrency.


## Operating Environment

Adology strives for near-continuous availability of its computing infrastructure, with each component able to fail independently and be restored within minutes. It is heavily dependent on AWS-managed services (MongoDB Atlas, Postgres RDS, SQS, AWS Load Balancer, AWS CloudFront).

<img src="https://billdonner.com/adology/two.png" width=700>

### Backend

- **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**: Managed service handling administrative tasks (backups, patching, scaling, failover).
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Fully managed cloud service for backups, scaling, replication, and maintenance.
- **Amazon S3**: Data is automatically replicated for high durability.
- **Amazon SQS**: Fully managed message queuing, used to decouple and scale pipeline components.
- **EC2 Servers**: Initially, two EC2 instances are deployed behind a load balancer. One functions as the Adology API server, and the other remains a warm standby (or handles static content).
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Serves as an interface between clients and backend services, enabling communication via WebSocket connections and message queues.
- **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances, automatically detecting and avoiding
  unhealthy instances.
- **Amazon Cloudwatch**: Monitors queue depths of SQS queues, S3, lambda performance, triggers.   PostgreSQL RDS has built-in CloudWatch metrics and enhanced monitoring.   MongoDB Atlas requires manual integration with CloudWatch via EventBridge. Both databases are monitored for query latency, CPU usage, memory, and disk I/O.

### Frontend

The main interface is a JavaScript application (the Adology UI) that serves as a Dashboard and communicates with the Adology API servers. Many API calls trigger long-running background Lambda functions, so WebSockets are used to notify the client when processing is complete. The UI then makes an additional API call to retrieve and display processed data.

The Dashboard programs use the Amazon API Gateway to communicate with SQS and sends all HTTPS: requests to the Load Balancer for delivery to the Adology Web Server and Adology Application Server.

Several Front End modules (Inquire, Enrich, AdSpend Reporting)follow this same pattern:

- optionally setup a WebSocket for notifications
- accept User Input from the Dashboard and post a Message on an SQS queue which triggers a long running operation on the backend.
- poll for completion by checking the database or receive a notificaiton of completion by a WebSocket call
- make an API call to receive the results that are now in the database


# **Central Data Spine**

The **Brand Table** serves as the primary table in the central data spine. It contains two categories of brand entries:

- **Analyzed Brands**: These brands are explicitly requested by customers and undergo full AI-driven analysis within Adology's processing engine.
- **Tracked Brands**: These brands are selected by Adology for tracking purposes. They are stored in S3 but remain unanalyzed until explicitly requested by a customer. The AI processing, which is expensive, is explicitly deferred until a customer changes its status to "analyzed"

The **Ads Table** serves to accumulate ads(video,image,text,other)
and their associated meta-data. The analysis of ads is a complex and time-consuming process and requires careful coordination by Adology to ensure a pleasant user experience.

These are the fundamental data components that are tracked  by the Spine:

## **Ad Descriptions and Attributes**

Natural language attributes are mapped to each ad through AI processing. Over 50 attributes are generated, all of which serve key functions, including:

- Providing text summaries across the application.
- Powering **INSIGHT** text summaries and chatbot functionality (**INQUIRE**).
- Acting as inputs for **trend detection**.

### **Detailed Ad Descriptions**

A single **500-word (max) description** is stored for each ad, providing a comprehensive textual summary. This is the primary field that is analyzed by many AI prompts.

### **Labels**

Close-ended, predefined labels are applied to ads using **UNIVERSAL** and **TREND** label taxonomies. Labels are used for:

- Enabling structured insights in graphs and charts.
- Powering features within modules such as **INSIGHT** and **TRACK**.
- Supporting **trend detection** models.

### **Embeddings**

Embeddings provide numerical representations of ad creatives or text content. Multiple types of embeddings are stored:

- **Text embeddings** of detailed descriptions, used for mapping images to insights within **INSIGHT**.
- **Visual embeddings** of ads, leveraged for **trend detection**.
- **Chatbot retrieval embeddings**, ensuring accurate information retrieval based on user queries.

   

# **Spine Operations**


The **Brand Descriptions Table** drives all operations within the central spine.

<img src="https://billdonner.com/adology/three.png" width=700>

Adology continuously updates the spine through a **background process (SpineScheduler)**, which sequentially scans the entire table of brands and places messages onto a **low-priority Acquire SQS Queue**. This triggers **Lambda functions** that update brands flagged for updates. In cases where brands source data from multiple locations, multiple Acquire-like SQS queues distribute processing across different Lambda functions.

To optimize response times, **Adology administrators pre-load popular and commonly accessed brands** into the system, ensuring their data is readily available before a request occurs. However, if a user requests a brand that has never been analyzed, the system follows the same general process but prioritizes the request using **high-priority SQS queues**.

### **Acquisition and Processing Flow**

1. At a high level, adology triggers **one of a set of SQS queues** to **download** content from brand-specific external sources into S3.
2. **Lambda functions** determine the acquisition strategy for each brand.
3. **Streaming-based ingestion** maximizes concurrency by eliminating a discrete upload step.
4. **AI-based content analysis** is performed using OpenAI API calls, which must be executed sequentially due to content dependencies.
 

# **Adology Intelligent Data Storage**

Adology is **more than a database**—it is an **intelligent processing engine**. Data storage is optimized for **fast retrieval** while balancing **AI processing costs**.

## **Data Hierarchy**

Adology maintains a structured hierarchy of logical data stores, continuously updated by the **Adology Service Infrastructure**.

<img src="https://billdonner.com/adology/four.png" width=700>

1. **Organization Account**
   Represents a customer entity that manages multiple brandspaces.

2. **Brandspaces**
   Each user is connected to at least one **brandspace**, which is centered on a **primary brand** and includes competitors and followed brands. Brandspaces define the **scope of analysis**.

3. **Brand-Level Intelligence**
   Includes:
   - Brand metadata (logos, categories, websites).
   - AI-generated **brand descriptions and trends**.
   - Connections to multiple data sources (**Meta, SERP, YouTube**).

4. **Channel-Level Tracking**
   Each brand runs ads across multiple channels. Ads are categorized based on **originating platform**.

5. **Shared Brand Data Store**
   - Stores **brand metadata** from all sources in **S3**.
   - Data is shared across **all Adology users**.

6. **Shared Ads Data Store**
   - Ads are permanently stored in **S3**, categorized by brand.
   - Data is available to **all Adology users**.

   

## **AI Summarization & Brand-Level Insights**

Once sufficient ad descriptions have been processed, Adology aggregates them into **brand-wide insights**. The AI continuously updates **high-level brand themes, messaging patterns, and performance insights**.

### **Brand-Level AI Data (Aggregated from Ad-Level Data)**
- **Theme Clusters** → Identifies groups of ads sharing **common storytelling techniques**.
- **Attribute Summaries** → AI-generated analysis of **features, claims, and offers**.
- **Messaging Trends** → Detects evolving patterns in **claims, benefits, and call-to-action (CTA) effectiveness**.
 

### **Reports & Competitive Analysis**

Adology generates **competitive reports** that synthesize **ad-level and brand-level AI insights**. These reports are integrated into **Inspire Recs & Trends** and **Market Intelligence/Brand Details** modules.

#### **Report Generation Process**
1. **AI pre-generates reports** at the conclusion of the data acquisition process.
2. Reports provide:
   - **Competitive benchmarking**.
   - **Creative trends analysis**.
   - **Strategic recommendations**.

3. **Example: Generating Ad Recommendations in INSPIRE**
   - **Data Acquisition** → AI pulls brand and competitor data.
   - **Ad Recommendation Prompt** → AI evaluates trends and ad effectiveness.
   - **Final Output** → Recommendations are displayed in **INSPIRE REC**.

#### **Report Updates**
Reports refresh **when two of the following conditions are met**:

- A **follower or competitor brand** is **added or removed**.
- A **new ad** arrives from a **followed** or **competitor brand**.
- Additional logic: **If seven days have elapsed AND new ads have been received**.

### **Stored Insights**
Reports act as **snapshots** of AI-generated insights, **reducing API processing costs** while preserving **data accuracy**.

**Examples of insights stored in reports:**
- **Ad Theme Comparisons** → *Nike emphasizes speed; Adidas focuses on lifestyle*.
- **Messaging Effectiveness Reports** → *Top 3 most successful CTAs in the running shoe industry*.
- **Trend Tracking** → *Increase in limited-time offers in Meta ads*.
 
### **Enhancements & Improvements**
To ensure maximum system performance, Adology employs:

- **Pre-built AI dashboards** → Minimize OpenAI API calls for efficiency.
- **Cached Reports & Insights** → Ensures fast retrieval for users.
- **Parallelized AI Processing Pipelines** → Optimizes query execution across distributed systems.

 
The **central data spine, intelligent data storage, and AI-powered insights** collectively power Adology’s **brand intelligence engine**. The system continuously refines and updates its models to **deliver actionable, high-quality marketing analytics** while **minimizing processing overhead**.




   

## The Main Acquisition Flow Example

A key performance metric is to process 10,000 ads in under 10 minutes. The overall process is:

<img src="https://billdonner.com/adology/one.png" width=400>

1. A frontend dashboard program places a message on the **Apify** SQS queue with a **BrandName**.
2. Multiple Apify processes handle this queue, using the Apify API to split the **BrandName** into a stream of URLs for specific images and videos.
3. The stream of URL-based messages is placed on the **Acquire** SQS queue, triggering downloads to S3 in parallel.
4. When each item is in S3, a new message (with S3 URL and metadata) is placed on the **Analyze** SQS queue.
5. Analysis processes consume these messages and perform AI tasks in parallel, limited by the AI service’s capacity.
6. All analyzed data is then stored in the database, and the frontend checks for completion or is notified via WebSockets.

Adology’s dashboard accesses S3 directly and only writes to the database through the Adology API.

   

## Other Flows

Most UX functionality involves responding to user actions by calling an Adology API endpoint. Additional recurring processes (e.g., periodic CRON jobs) place messages on the Apify or SerpApi SQS queues to keep brand data updated.



## Background Flow

There is a background process, either a Kron job, or Celery job, or perhaps a dormant EC2 process that periodically checks for new content on all of its sources for each Brand in the Brands Table.

As new content / ads flow into the acquisition engines, the Ads Table is is updated. The new content is uploaded to S3 as it is being acquired.

Depending on the brand and whether it is being followed or analyzed by any customer, a message specifying additional AI work is enqued to a SQS queue for Lambda processing.

## User Interactive Flow

Apart from the background, a Dashboard user can enter an arbitrary Brand name , requesting complete analysis of the competion according to a preset profile in the active brandspace/workspace. In this case a message containing the brandname and a websocket ID is enqueued to the appropriate SQS queue for analysis and processing.

Customer Administrators set up users and separately workspaces for their users. These workspaces/brandspaces contain specific lists of brands to track and brands to analyze. As the user interface adjusts these lists in response to administrative requests, it must also adjust the appropriate row in the Brands Table, to inser or remove onself from these lists.

Most users will work for one customer. A User working for multiple customers will need to use distinct emails.



<img src="https://billdonner.com/adology/dbo-erd1.png" width=500>


### Project Requirements

- **JSON, not CSV**
  Data should preferrably stored in database fields or as JSON blobs, and never as CSV. JSON is more expressive. CSV can be generated at the last moment when an API call must deliver an explicit CSV object.
  
  - **SQS First**
  Lambda expressions should not be invoked directly from application software. Instead, a message with a custom payload should be placed on a FIFO SQS queue which will in turn trigger one of a group of lambas to handle the message,.
   

- **Coding Standards & Documentation**
   A consistent code style (PEP8) is recommended, enforced by linters (e.g., flake8, Black).
   Comprehensive docstrings and inline comments should be included for clarity and maintainability.

- **Centralized Configuration & Secrets Management**
  All hardcoded values (API keys, model names, S3 bucket names) should be externalized in configuration files or environment variables.
 

- **Structured Logging & Monitoring**
 Print statements should be replaced with a structured logging framework that includes contextual data (user IDs, request IDs, timestamps).  CloudWatch logging and monitoring systems will report exceptional events to Adology operions

- **Error Handling & Retry Logic**
  Specific exception handling (e.g., JSONDecodeError, KeyError) should be used instead of broad `except` blocks.
  Standardized retry mechanisms (e.g., the tenacity library) are recommended for transient errors in external API/S3 interactions.

- **Separation of Concerns & Modularity**
 Code should be refactored to separate business logic from I/O operations (database, S3, external APIs).
 Duplicated logic can be consolidated into shared modules and utilities.

- **Concurrency & Asynchronous I/O**
 Thread pool sizes should be evaluated. There is a two level concurrency scheme - first the lambdas provide fanout and secondly the internal python concurrent worker threads provide the opportunity to tune concurrency.  Proper thread safety is necessary when sharing resources.


### Best Practices for Writing Functions for Parallel Execution

- **Statelessness**
  Functions should avoid depending on or modifying shared state. Any required state is preferably stored in a database or S3.

- **Idempotency**
  Multiple identical invocations should produce the same result without unintended side effects. This approach supports safe retries and distributed workflows.

- **Robust Error Handling**
  Comprehensive error handling and logging greatly assist in diagnosing issues in parallel environments.

- **Granularity**
  Smaller, well-defined functions that perform a single unit of work scale and maintain more easily.

- **Testing**
  Functions should be tested in isolation and within the parallel execution framework to ensure correct behavior in concurrent scenarios.

```
here is the initial prompt:
```
We need to build an asynchronous, Python-based system for processing advertising content (images and videos) from a list of URLs associated with a brand. The system should efficiently download, analyze, and store data for further AI processing. Here’s the complete architecture and requirements:
  1.  URL Processing and Concurrency:
  •  Each URL must be processed as an independent asyncio task.
  •  Use an asyncio semaphore to control the number of concurrent tasks (downloads, S3 uploads, and AI calls) to prevent resource exhaustion.
  •  Implement retries with exponential backoff for any task that fails (e.g., download, AI call). If a task fails after all retries, log the failure and continue processing the remaining URLs.
  2.  Streaming Data from Download to S3:
  •  Instead of fully downloading the file locally, stream the content directly to S3.
  •  Use an asynchronous HTTP library (like aiohttp) to fetch the URL data in chunks and an asynchronous S3 client (like aiobotocore) to stream these chunks directly into S3.
  •  This streaming approach should reduce latency and disk I/O. It also allows AI processing to begin once enough data is available or once the upload is confirmed.
  •  Robust error handling is necessary to manage interruptions in the data stream (e.g., resuming uploads or restarting streams).
  3.  Per-URL Pipeline Stages:
  •  Streaming to S3: Begin streaming data immediately from the source to S3.
  •  Individual AI Analysis: Once the content is safely stored (or as soon as a buffer is available), perform AI tasks including:
  •  Video/image analysis
  •  Computing embeddings
  •  Temporary Data Logging: Maintain a flat temporary file (or in-memory buffer) per URL. Append the results from each AI stage to this file. This log will be used later for aggregate analysis and database insertion.
  4.  Aggregate AI Analysis Across URLs:
  •  After processing all URLs (regardless of any individual failures), wait for all asynchronous tasks to complete.
  •  Run a second stage of AI analysis that operates across the entire dataset. This might involve:
  •  Aggregating metadata
  •  Refining embeddings with cross-URL context
  •  Detecting trends or anomalies that require a complete view of the brand’s data
  5.  Final Bulk Push into Postgres:
  •  Collect all temporary analysis logs from the processed URLs.
  •  Prepare the aggregated data in a batch-ready format (e.g., an array of dictionaries or a DataFrame).
  •  Perform a bulk insertion into Postgres in a single transaction (or carefully batched transactions if needed):
  •  Use Postgres’ bulk insertion capabilities (e.g., the COPY command or libraries like psycopg2’s execute_values).
  •  Wrap the bulk insert in a transaction to ensure atomicity.
  •  For hundreds of URLs, consider splitting the bulk operation into manageable chunks to avoid timeouts or memory issues.
  6.  Modular AI Library Interface:
  •  Create a standardized interface for all AI routines. Each AI function should accept a standardized data structure (like a dict or dataclass) and return results in a uniform format.
  •  Ensure that the AI methods (from different teams or sources) can be easily plugged into the pipeline at appropriate stages.
  •  Design a testing harness that allows isolated testing of each AI method with options to use either real or dummy data. This harness should support both unit tests for individual pipeline stages and integration tests for the entire workflow.
  7.  Overall Considerations:
  •  The entire pipeline runs as a single or a coordinated set of asyncio tasks.
  •  Semaphore control guarantees controlled concurrency.
  •  Error handling ensures that failures in individual URL processing do not halt the overall process.
  •  The system should be scalable to hundreds of URLs per brand, ensuring efficiency from streaming ingest to the final bulk database transaction.

Implement this design to efficiently handle large-scale advertising content ingestion and analysis, leveraging asynchronous operations, robust error management, and modular AI integration.

``` ```
 `Below is a refined development prompt based on your initial thoughts:
```
AWS Python System Development Prompt

Objective:
Build a Python-based system that acquires remote advertising content (images and videos) from various sources, processes the content with external AI routines, and efficiently stores the results—including embeddings in a FAISS vector database and metadata in a relational database.

System Overview:
  •  Content Acquisition:
  •  Start with a list of URLs (sourced from a command-line file or an SQS message) associated with a specific advertising brand.
  •  For each URL, initiate an asynchronous task that downloads the content and uploads it to Amazon S3.
  •  Control the level of concurrency (fan-out) to ensure efficient use of resources during these I/O-bound operations.
  •  AI Processing Pipeline:
  •  Stage 1: Per-Content Analysis
  •  Each image or video undergoes initial AI analysis (e.g., slicing, dicing, extracting features).
  •  The processing includes off-board AI calls to services (e.g., Amazon AI or other external providers) that compute embeddings and additional metrics.
  •  Intermediate analysis results are appended to a temporary, flat file specific to each URL.
  •  Stage 2: Aggregated Analysis
  •  Once individual content processing is complete, a second round of analysis is performed on the aggregated set of results.
  •  Additional AI cycles can be incorporated as needed.
  •  After processing, the temporary file data is finalized and re-uploaded to S3.
  •  Data Storage:
  •  Collect all temporary files for the brand and write the compiled data to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) in a single, efficient transaction.
  •  Store computed embeddings in a FAISS vector database for rapid similarity search and analysis.
  •  Modular AI Library:
  •  Develop a standardized interface for AI routines (from teams F and W) that abstracts the prompting and detailed processing logic.
  •  Each AI method should:
  •  Accept a block (or blocks) of data.
  •  Return structured results that can be seamlessly integrated into the pipeline.
  •  The library should be pluggable into the pipeline at designated points to maintain flexibility.
  •  Pipeline Execution:
  •  The entire process is orchestrated within a single asyncio task, maximizing efficiency for I/O-bound operations.
  •  Incorporate explicit conditionals and concurrency control to manage processing steps and resource allocation.
  •  Testing Harness:
  •  Create a testing framework that allows developers to run and validate individual AI methods independently.
  •  Ensure that the harness simulates real pipeline conditions to facilitate robust unit and integration testing.

Additional Considerations:
  •  Emphasize modular design and reusability across different components of the system.
  •  Implement robust error handling, logging, and monitoring to ensure resilience and observability.
  •  Secure AWS integrations (S3, SQS, etc.) following best practices for credentials and network access.
  •  Optimize temporary file handling and batch processing to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

This prompt outlines the high-level architecture and key components of the system, ensuring that the solution is scalable, efficient, and well-integrated with AWS services while providing flexibility for AI processing enhancements.

``` 
Here’s a summary of the best practices we have concluded for handling various situations related to concurrency, API calls, and embeddings in Pythonm please include these


```


Handling OpenAI API Calls (Async)
  •  Use openai.AsyncClient() for non-blocking API calls.
  •  Use await client.completions.create(...) instead of synchronous calls to ensure optimal concurrency.
  •  asyncio.gather(...) can be used to run multiple OpenAI API requests concurrently.

Handling Amazon Embedding Calls (Sync)
  •  Amazon’s API for embeddings might be synchronous, which would block the event loop.
  •  Use asyncio.to_thread() or asyncio.run_in_executor() to offload Amazon’s blocking API calls to a separate thread while keeping the main event loop responsive.
  •  If Amazon provides an async API in the future, prefer that instead of threading.

Combining Async OpenAI Calls & Blocking API Calls
  •  Use OpenAI’s async API for LLM calls.
  •  Offload blocking calls to threads using asyncio.to_thread() or asyncio.run_in_executor(None, blocking_function).
  •  If there are multiple blocking calls, create separate asyncio tasks that wrap asyncio.to_thread().

Handling Multiple Concurrent Requests
  •  Use asyncio.gather() to run multiple API calls at the same time.
  •  If one request depends on another:
  1.  Start the first batch concurrently.
  2.  Process their results.
  3.  Use results to make the next request.

Example:

results = await asyncio.gather(call_1(), call_2())
final_result = await call_3(results)

Handling Threads & Event Loop
  •  Python threads run independently from asyncio, but the GIL can limit their performance for CPU-bound tasks.
  •  Use threads for blocking I/O operations, such as:
  •  Blocking HTTP APIs
  •  File system operations
  •  Database queries (when an async driver isn’t available)

Managing Threading Overhead
  •  Using asyncio.to_thread() is preferred over manually creating threads when only occasional offloading is needed.
  •  If handling many frequent calls, consider using a ThreadPoolExecutor to reuse threads efficiently.

Mixing Async & Threaded Calls in a Clean Way
  •  When integrating multiple services (e.g., OpenAI async calls + Amazon sync embeddings):
  •  Keep OpenAI requests fully async.
  •  Move Amazon API calls to a separate thread via asyncio.to_thread().
  •  Use asyncio.gather() to process multiple operations in parallel.

Example:

async def process_data():
    openai_task = fetch_openai_result()  # Async OpenAI call
    amazon_task = asyncio.to_thread(call_amazon_embedding)  # Blocking API in thread
    openai_result, amazon_result = await asyncio.gather(openai_task, amazon_task)
    return openai_result, amazon_result

Scaling Considerations
  •  If requests are high-frequency, consider using a queue-based worker pattern:
  •  Async tasks can enqueue work to be processed by a worker pool in background threads.

and incorporate this ```# Point-by-Point Commentary on SQS-Driven Lambda Steps

Below is a point-by-point commentary on the steps you’ve outlined, focusing on best practices and potential pitfalls for AWS Lambda functions that process messages from SQS.

---

## 1. Perform database reads

**Purpose**
Often, you need some initial data from the database to decide how to process the incoming message. This read can help confirm the current state of the system or gather related information.

**Considerations**
- **Performance**: Large or frequent reads can add overhead. In high-volume scenarios, even minor overhead can accumulate quickly.
- **Error Handling**: If the read fails (e.g., due to a network or DB outage), decide whether to retry or fail fast.
- **Idempotency**: Ensure that repeated reads and processing do not lead to inconsistent states if a message is delivered more than once.

---

## 2. Perform External IO or AI

**Purpose**
You may need to call external services or AI endpoints to enrich the data or make decisions before proceeding.

**Considerations**
- **Latency & Timeouts**: External calls can be slow or fail. Implement retries with exponential backoff, and ensure timeouts are handled properly.
- **Costs**: External services (like AI APIs) can be expensive; be sure to manage unexpected spikes.
- **Network Failures**: Always have a strategy for handling network errors.
- **Transaction Boundaries**: Typically, do external calls _before_ opening a transaction to avoid holding a DB transaction open while waiting on external responses.

---

## 3. Open transaction

**Purpose**
To ensure atomicity of subsequent database operations (reads/writes) related to the message processing.

**Considerations**
- **Transaction Scope**: Keep it as small as possible (focus on the reads and writes that need strict atomicity).
- **Transaction Support**: The approach varies depending on your DB (e.g., RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB transactions, etc.).
- **Error Handling**: If opening the transaction fails, decide whether to rethrow the error or handle it gracefully.

---

## 4. Perform database reads (inside the transaction)

**Purpose**
In some cases, you need a fresh read within the same transactional context to ensure consistent data.

**Considerations**
- **Consistency**: This ensures the most up-to-date state just before writing.
- **Locking**: Depending on isolation levels, these reads may lock rows. Keep the transaction short to avoid performance issues.

---

## 5. Perform database writes

**Purpose**
The main operation of updating or inserting data based on the message content.

**Considerations**
- **Atomicity**: If something fails here, you rely on the transaction to roll back.
- **Idempotency**: Use unique IDs or version checks so that reprocessing the same message doesn’t cause duplicate writes.
- **Performance**: Minimize the number of writes in a single transaction to reduce latency and the chance of partial failures.

---

## 6. Close transaction

**Purpose**
Commits or rolls back the transaction to finalize the database state.

**Considerations**
- **Potential Errors**: Errors during commit can occur due to network or DB issues.
- **Connection Handling**: Make sure to release DB resources properly in Lambda since it’s a serverless environment and connections may persist across invocations.

---

## 7. Handle transaction close errors

**Purpose**
If the commit or rollback fails, you need a strategy to maintain data integrity.

**Considerations**
- **Rollback Logic**: DB systems often auto-rollback on commit failure. Verify that your code correctly detects and responds to the final state.
- **Retries**: Depending on the error, you may re-run the message processing. SQS’s at-least-once delivery model can help by re-delivering the message if you throw an exception.
- **Alerting**: Repeated transaction failures may indicate systemic issues (e.g., DB deadlocks or capacity constraints).

---

## 8. Send new messages as necessary

**Purpose**
After successfully updating the database, you may need to trigger further processes by sending messages to other queues or topics.

**Considerations**
- **Order of Operations**: Typically, commit your DB transaction _before_ sending new messages.
- **Idempotency**: If needed, use message deduplication strategies.
- **Failure Scenarios**: If sending messages fails, the DB transaction is already committed. Have a way to detect or retry sending separately.

---

## 9. Delete the incoming message

**Purpose**
Acknowledge successful processing by removing the message from SQS.

**Considerations**
- **Timing**: Do this _only after_ confirming successful completion of all prior steps.
- **Visibility Timeout**: Ensure that processing time does not exceed the SQS visibility timeout (or extend it as needed).

---

## 10. Optionally notify users

**Purpose**
Send a user-facing notification, like an email or push alert, reflecting the outcome of the processing.

**Considerations**
- **Retries**: Notification services can fail. Decide how crucial the notification is and whether you’ll retry.
- **User Impact**: Avoid spamming users if the same message is processed multiple times.
- **Timing**: Typically done after a successful transaction. If the transaction fails, you likely don’t want to send a “success” notification.

---

## Additional Best Practices

1. **Idempotency**
   - SQS guarantees _at least once_ delivery, so messages can be delivered multiple times. Use a strategy (e.g., unique IDs or “processed” flags in the DB) to prevent duplicate or inconsistent outcomes.

2. **Error Handling & Retries**
   - If your Lambda throws an unhandled exception, the message remains in the queue. Implement robust logging and ensure you either handle or re-throw intentionally.

3. **Visibility Timeout**
   - Make sure your Lambda’s runtime won’t exceed the SQS visibility timeout. Increase it or extend it dynamically if your logic is long-running.

4. **Connection Reuse**
   - Consider initializing DB connections outside the handler so they can be reused across Lambda invocations. This can improve performance, but requires careful management.

5. **Scaling Considerations**
   - SQS can scale concurrency based on queue traffic. If your DB can’t handle numerous simultaneous connections, configure concurrency limits for the Lambda.

6. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Use structured logging and tag logs with a correlation ID or message metadata for better traceability. Implement metrics and alarms for error rates, timeouts, and throughput.

### Conclusion

Your outlined steps form a solid structure for handling SQS-driven Lambda workflows that involve a transactional database. Keep transactions short, implement idempotency, and ensure proper error handling and retries. With these foundations, your team will have a robust pattern that can scale while maintaining data integrity.
