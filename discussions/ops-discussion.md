# Ops Dashboard Discussion

Q:I want to build some monitoring screens on top of an AWS infrastructure. This will include looking at Q counts on SQSQ’s looking at error, messages in console, logs and generating alerts for people on their mobile phones when any of this goes astray please make some suggestions for delivering all this information into a dashboard like situation for an operational user. It’s OK if some of this ends up on terminal screens without a gui


A:Great, you’re essentially looking to build a practical, lightweight observability layer for your AWS infrastructure—something that provides real-time or near-real-time feedback on the health and state of your system (queues, logs, errors, alerts) in a way that’s actionable for ops folks.



Here’s a breakdown of how you could structure this using AWS-native services and lightweight tools, keeping the option open for GUI and terminal-based dashboards:

## Core Components to Monitor
	1.	SQS Queue Lengths & Dead-Letter Queues
	2.	CloudWatch Logs (from Lambdas, EC2, etc.)
	3.	CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms
	4.	Error Rates / Anomalous Events
	5.	Custom Application Events
	6.	Alerts to Mobile (SMS, Push, etc.)

Delivery into Dashboards / Screens

#### Option 1: CloudWatch Dashboards + Terminal Monitors
	•	CloudWatch Dashboard can visualize:
	•	SQS queue depths
	•	Custom metrics (e.g., failed jobs, error counts)
	•	Lambda error/invocation counts
	•	CPU/memory usage, if EC2 is involved
	•	Pair this with CloudWatch Logs Insights for structured queries across logs.
	•	Terminal-based screen: write a Python or Bash script using boto3 that:
	•	Polls SQS lengths
	•	Queries log groups for recent ERROR logs
	•	Prints a summarized view every N seconds (like a htop or watch)

#### Option 2: Grafana + CloudWatch + Loki (or Amazon Managed Grafana)
	•	Use Grafana to ingest:
	•	CloudWatch metrics (via data source plugin)
	•	Logs from Loki or directly from CloudWatch
	•	Build rich, interactive dashboards
	•	Grafana supports alerting to email, Slack, PagerDuty, mobile push (via plugins or integrations)

#### Option 3: Terminal-First UX
	•	Build a custom TUI (Terminal UI) using Python libraries like:
	•	rich for styled logs and dashboards
	•	textual for multi-panel terminal UIs
	•	You can connect it to boto3 or CloudWatch APIs to render live updating views of system state

#### Option 4: Minimalist Web GUI using React or Streamlit
	•	React frontend polling your internal API layer
	•	Or a Streamlit app (super fast to prototype) that displays:
	•	Error logs
	•	Queue counts
	•	Last alert state
	•	Add WebSocket or polling for near real-time updates

### Alerting to Mobile
	1.	SNS (Simple Notification Service)
	•	Use it to send SMS, email, or forward to mobile push platforms (like Firebase, Pushover, or Slack with mobile notifications).
	•	Tie this into CloudWatch Alarms or your own logic.
	2.	Third-Party Integrations
	•	PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or VictorOps can receive alerts and handle on-call rotations, escalation, etc.
	•	Hook up via AWS Lambda → Webhook → 3rd-party platform
	3.	Lightweight Slack Bot
	•	Python Lambda function that watches queues, logs, and sends alerts to a Slack channel
	•	Use mobile Slack app for notifications

Suggested Monitoring Loop (Ops Perspective)

What	How	View
SQS Queue	Poll via boto3 or CW Metrics	Terminal or Dashboard
Logs	Query CloudWatch Logs Insights	Web dashboard or Terminal snapshot
Errors	Custom metric + CW Alarm	Alert + display in panel
Alerts	CW Alarm + SNS → Slack/SMS/Firebase	Mobile Notification

### Bonus Ideas
	•	Use Athena to query historical logs stored in S3
	•	Use AWS Lambda to regularly push state summaries to a central place (e.g., DynamoDB + terminal polling, or a Redis pub-sub feed)
	•	Implement “heartbeat” tracking for critical services and raise alerts if no heartbeat received

Would you prefer to go more terminal-focused, or are you looking to eventually have a proper web-based dashboard too? I can mock up a terminal UI or web dashboard sample for you if you like.
