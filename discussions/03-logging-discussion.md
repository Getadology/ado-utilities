## Logging and Metrics 

I have an application running on AWS infrastructure. The application is built largely in Python and is mostly a server plus some background processes. It is used by clients over HTTPS. It also maintains a WebSocket connection with each of the clients. What I want to do is build a logging system, which will comprehensively log all external calls that are made inside the server infrastructure to external resources such as the OpenAI servers, the Amazon servers, which are used for computing embeddings, and anybody else's server in a pseudo-synchronous manner, where it looks like we're calling synchronously, but it's actually happening inside a thread or an async I.O. Anyway, I want all of this to be logged and I want every error message in the system to be categorized as whether it's just informational warning or such, and we need all the print statements in the software to be changed into console logging statements. I would like to talk to you about doing this systematically across the code base, which at this point is less than 20,000 lines of code. I'd like to get these first principles installed here right now before we go much further. Let me have your thoughts about this.

A: That’s a very solid instinct—laying down foundational logging and observability early will save you significant pain down the line. Here’s how I’d suggest approaching this systematically, combining best practices with ease of integration:

1. Use Python’s logging Library (Not print)

Replace print() with structured logging:
  •  Use logging.getLogger(__name__) per module
  •  Configure different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  •  Direct logs to stdout/stderr (for Docker), files, or remote systems like CloudWatch, Sentry, or ELK

Logging setup example:
```python
import logging
import sys

def setup_logging():
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO,
        format="%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s",
        handlers=[
            logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
        ]
    )
```
Call setup_logging() early in your main entry point.

2. Wrap External Calls for Tracing and Error Classification

Create a decorator or context manager for all external API calls that:
  •  Logs request metadata (target, method, payload, headers if needed)
  •  Logs response time and status
  •  Categorizes and logs exceptions appropriately

Example:
```python
import logging
import time
from functools import wraps

logger = logging.getLogger("external")

def log_external_call(service_name):
    def decorator(fn):
        @wraps(fn)
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start = time.time()
            try:
                result = await fn(*args, **kwargs)
                elapsed = time.time() - start
                logger.info(f"{service_name} call succeeded in {elapsed:.2f}s")
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                elapsed = time.time() - start
                logger.error(f"{service_name} call failed in {elapsed:.2f}s: {e}", exc_info=True)
                raise
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```
Use it like:
```python
@log_external_call("OpenAI")
async def call_openai(...):
    ...
```
This can be adapted for sync calls using ThreadPoolExecutor or standard functions.

3. Log Levels for Application Events
  •  DEBUG: Developer details
  •  INFO: High-level application flow
  •  WARNING: Unexpected but recoverable issues
  •  ERROR: Failed processes or exceptions
  •  CRITICAL: System-wide or unrecoverable failures

Make it policy to always use a level and structured messages.

4. Replace print() Programmatically

You can scan and patch all print() statements with a script:

grep -rnw . -e 'print('

And optionally use rope or libcst to safely rewrite to logger.info().

5. Integration with Observability Tools

Once your loggers are standardized:
  •  You can redirect them to AWS CloudWatch using watchtower
  •  Or integrate Sentry, Datadog, or Prometheus/Grafana for alerts and metrics
  •  WebSocket events and trace IDs can also be logged for session-level visibility

6. Bonus: Add Request/Session Context

If your server handles concurrent sessions (WebSockets especially), consider integrating something like contextvars or structlog to tag logs with session/user IDs.
