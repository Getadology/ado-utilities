# AWS Environment
This note describes the core AWS components you specified for constructing a medium-scale advertising ingestion and query system, including key management and disaster recovery.

1. Amazon S3
	•	Purpose: Primary storage for raw creative assets (images, videos) and intermediate AI outputs (such as logs and aggregated data).
	•	Operations: Data is uploaded in a streaming fashion to minimize disk I/O and enable rapid analysis.

2. PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS)
	•	Purpose: Houses relational data, including brandspace records, summary analytics, references to S3 URLs, and any structured outputs resulting from AI tasks.
	•	Operations: Bulk insertion operations ensure high performance for batch updates.

3. MongoDB Atlas
	•	Purpose: Maintains flexible or semi-structured data for detailed metadata or AI-enriched documents.
	•	Operations: Serves as a complement to PostgreSQL for data that does not fit a strictly relational schema.

4. Optional Vector Database (e.g., FAISS)
	•	Purpose: Stores embeddings computed by AI services (OpenAI, Amazon, etc.) for near real-time similarity search.
	•	Deployment: Runs on Amazon EC2 or as a managed service, depending on scale and performance needs.

5. Message Queues (Amazon SQS)
	•	Purpose: Decouples ingestion from processing and enables parallel consumption by multiple workers.
	•	Operations: Supports worker Lambdas or EC2-based consumers that process queued items in parallel.

6. Server Infrastructure
	1.	Amazon EC2
	•	Runs Adology API servers and handles heavier compute tasks.
	2.	AWS Lambda
	•	Performs asynchronous tasks that scale automatically (such as ingestion triggers and parallelizable AI tasks).
	3.	Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) + Amazon API Gateway
	•	Balances incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate backend services.

7. AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
	•	Purpose: Manages all encryption keys (for S3 objects, database encryption at rest, and any custom application-level encryption).
	•	Integration:
	•	Encrypts S3 buckets using customer-managed KMS keys (SSE-KMS).
	•	Encrypts RDS, MongoDB Atlas (if configured to use your KMS keys), and EBS volumes on EC2 instances.
	•	Encrypts environment variables and other sensitive configuration in Lambda.

8. AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store
	•	Purpose: Securely stores and rotates database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.
	•	Integration:
	•	Allows Lambdas, EC2 instances, or containers to retrieve credentials at runtime without storing them in code.
	•	Automates credential rotation for RDS or custom key stores.

9. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
	•	Purpose: Implements role-based access control for each service (S3 read/write roles, RDS access roles, KMS usage policies, etc.).
	•	Integration:
	•	Ensures least-privilege access for each component.
	•	Grants Lambdas only the permissions they require (such as reading specific S3 buckets or putting messages into SQS).

10. VPC & Networking
	•	Purpose: Isolates data and services within private subnets and controls inbound/outbound traffic.
	•	Integration:
	•	Uses S3 VPC endpoints to keep traffic internal.
	•	Hosts RDS, MongoDB Atlas (via peering), or an EC2-based vector database in private subnets for security and reduced latency.

11. Amazon CloudWatch
	•	Purpose: Collects application logs, metrics, and alarms for SQS, Lambda, or any custom metrics (such as queue depth and inference latency).
	•	Integration:
	•	Sets alarms for high error rates, long queue times, or unexpected traffic patterns.
	•	Stores logs (e.g., Lambda and API logs) for debugging.

12. AWS CloudFormation or Terraform
	•	Purpose: Defines and manages AWS resource stacks in a consistent, repeatable manner.
	•	Integration:
	•	Version-controls resource definitions (S3 buckets, VPC, RDS instances, and roles).
	•	Automatically deploys changes across environments (development, staging, production).

13. Disaster Recovery & Backup
	•	AWS Backup
	•	Centralizes backups for RDS, EBS volumes, and other supported services.
	•	Schedules backups and enforces data retention policies.
	•	Ensures tested restore procedures align with compliance and SLA requirements.

This environment provides a scalable, secure foundation for advertising ingestion, AI-powered enrichment, and efficient querying of both relational and non-relational data.
